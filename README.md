# bookbot
[Boot.dev's](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend) guided project to create a bookbot with Python.

**DISCLAIMER**: simple script to count words and letters of a given single page `.txt` and output to stdout. (*NOT AN ACTUAL BOT*)

# To Run
1. Download [Project Gutenberg's Frankenstein](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asweigart/codebreaker/master/frankenstein.txt).
2. add a `/books` directory in the project root folder and save the text file there.
3. Run the following in your desired terminal:
```python
python main.py
```
To change text files, change `path_to_book` file path in `main()` and remember to include them in `/books`
